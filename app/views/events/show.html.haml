      %p
        The audience for RailsConf are developers, designers, entrepeneurs, CFOs, and anyone with an interest in web development. Your presentation should contribute to their knowledge and curiosity.
      %p
        Please provide sufficient detail in your submission to enable the reviewers to understand your proposal and clearly identify what an attendee will gain from attending your session.
      %p
        Your proposal should include the following information:
        %ol.u-margin-med-top
          %li Author(s)
          %li Title

      %h4.u-font-bold Review Process
      %p
        We are looking for a diverse lineup of speakers from different backgrounds speaking on a wide range of topics.
        %ol.u-margin-med-top
          %li Submission. Your talk proposal is submitted through our CFP app before midnight AEST on 17 August. Please include as much information you can about your talk.
          %li Shortlisting. A group of three reviewers with different backgrounds and experience levels will read through all talk proposals with anonymised speaker details. They will shortlist roughly double the amount of required talks.
          %li Selection. To allow the review group to select the talks, the shortlisted proposals will be de-anonymised so that speaker diversity and experience can factor into the final decision. We believe this is a necessary step to ensure that our lineup is as varied as possible. The reviewers will select the required amount of talks, with an additional buffer of talks we draw from if any of our initially selected speakers pull out.
          %li Notification. Selected speakers will be notified via email. We aim to have all speakers selected before 31st August.
